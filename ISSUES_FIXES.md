# Marketing Calendar - Issues & Fixes

## Identified Issues

1. **Navigation Issues**
   - Outdated links to pages like "Calendar" and "Tradeshows" that don't have proper implementations
   - Fixed by removing these links from the navigation menu

2. **Database Schema Mismatches**
   - The database schema has evolved but the TypeScript interfaces don't match
   - The Resources table needs additional columns: `hourly_rate`, `media_type`, `team_id`
   - Missing tables: `teams` and proper relationships

3. **Type Definition Issues**
   - The Supabase types don't match the actual database schema
   - Missing types for the campaigns and brands tables
   - Brief interface missing required `brand_id` and `campaign_id` fields

4. **Resource Management Page Failures**
   - 400 errors when trying to add/edit resources due to schema mismatches
   - "Object" error in logs indicating missing properties

5. **Brief Loading Issues**
   - Briefs failing to load due to missing `brand_id` field in the interfaces

## Applied Fixes

1. **Navigation Cleanup**
   - Removed unused "Calendar" and "Tradeshows" links from `DashboardLayout.tsx`

2. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Created `update_resources_schema.sql` to add missing columns to the resources table
   - Added `hourly_rate`, `media_type`, and `team_id` to the resources table
   - Ensured proper team table creation with relationships

3. **Type Definition Updates**
   - Updated `src/types/supabase.ts` with complete database schema information
   - Added missing tables (brands, campaigns, teams)
   - Updated existing types with missing fields
   - Updated `src/types/index.ts` with the missing fields for Brief

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migrations**
   - Execute the `update_resources_schema.sql` script in your Supabase dashboard or via the CLI
   - This will add all the missing columns and relationships

2. **Test Resource Management**
   - After applying the database changes, test adding and editing resources
   - Verify that all fields are correctly saved and retrieved

3. **Test Brief Management**
   - Verify that briefs load correctly and the brand_id field is properly handled
   - Test creating new briefs to ensure all required fields are present

4. **Update Other Components**
   - Check all components that interact with resources or briefs to ensure they handle the new fields correctly

## Long-term Improvements

1. **Database Schema Versioning**
   - Implement proper database migration tracking
   - Consider using a migration tool like Prisma or TypeORM

2. **Type Generation**
   - Use Supabase's automatic type generation to keep types in sync with the database schema
   - Run `supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/types/supabase.ts` periodically

3. **Component Testing**
   - Add comprehensive tests for components to catch issues with data structures
   - Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
