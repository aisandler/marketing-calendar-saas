# Settings Section Reorganization

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to reorganize the Brands and User Management sections into a unified Settings section within the Marketing Calendar application. The goal was to improve the application's navigation structure by consolidating administrative features into a centralized Settings section.

## Key Changes

1. **Navigation Structure**
   - Created a new "Settings" entry in the main navigation with sub-items
   - Moved "Brands" from the main navigation to a sub-item under Settings
   - Moved "Users" from the main navigation to a sub-item under Settings (admin-only)

2. **New Components**
   - Created a new Settings landing page (`Settings.tsx`) that provides access to the various settings sections
   - Implemented a card-based interface for navigating to different settings areas

3. **Routes Organization**
   - Added a `/settings` route that serves as an entry point to the Settings section
   - Preserved existing `/brands` and `/users` routes for backward compatibility

4. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Enhanced visual feedback when navigating settings sub-sections
   - Implemented active state highlighting for both the Settings section and active sub-items
   - Ensured consistent behavior across both mobile and desktop layouts

## Technical Implementation

### New Files
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx`: Landing page for the Settings section

### Modified Files
- `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx`: Updated navigation structure, added Settings section with sub-items
- `src/App.tsx`: Added routing for the new Settings page

### Benefits
- **Improved Organization**: Related administrative functions are now grouped logically
- **Cleaner Navigation**: Main navigation is more focused on core application features
- **Scalability**: New administrative features can be easily added to the Settings section
- **Consistency**: Follows common application design patterns where administrative functions are grouped in Settings

## Next Steps
- Consider adding additional settings sections (e.g., Application Settings, Notifications, etc.)
- Evaluate the need for further organization of brand-related settings
- Gather user feedback on the new navigation structure
