# Marketing Calendar LLM Chat Integration Plan

## Project Overview
This project will integrate a natural language AI chat interface into the marketing calendar application, enabling users to create, view, edit, and manage marketing briefs, campaigns, and resources through conversational interactions.

## Goals
- Allow natural language creation/editing of marketing assets
- Enable complex queries across multiple entities
- Maintain security and data integrity
- Create an intuitive UI that integrates with existing app design
- Build in manageable phases for a non-coder to implement with AI assistance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Chat UI Implementation**
  - Add a floating chat button in the corner of each page
  - Create collapsible chat panel with basic styling matching app theme
  - Implement basic message history display
  - Add simple text input with send button

- **Basic LLM Connection**
  - Set up Claude/OpenAI API connection
  - Create a simple query-response flow
  - Store conversation in browser session
  - Implement basic error handling

- **Task for Non-Coder**: Define UI requirements, styling preferences, and example queries to test.

### Phase 2: Read Operations (Weeks 3-4)
- **Database Query Layer**
  - Create predefined query templates for each entity type
  - Implement intent detection for basic queries ("Show me briefs due this month")
  - Build response formatter to display results in chat
  - Add ability to link directly to relevant app pages from chat

- **Context Management**
  - Maintain conversation state between messages
  - Track which entities were previously discussed
  - Implement basic reference resolution ("Show me more details about that campaign")

- **Task for Non-Coder**: Create comprehensive list of query types users might ask, categorized by entity type.

### Phase 3: Create/Update Operations (Weeks 5-7)
- **Entity Creation**
  - Build templates for creating each entity type through natural language
  - Implement validation before database changes
  - Add confirmation step for data modifications
  - Create success/failure messages with clear feedback

- **Entity Updates**
  - Implement safe update operations with confirmation
  - Add disambiguation for unclear references ("Which campaign do you want to update?")
  - Create undo functionality for changes

- **Task for Non-Coder**: Define entity schemas in plain language, including required fields and validation rules.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 8-10)
- **Complex Operations**
  - Enable multi-step workflows ("Find all campaigns without resources and create resource requests")
  - Add batch operations capability ("Move all April events to May")
  - Implement data analysis requests ("Summarize resource allocation across Q2")

- **UI Enhancements**
  - Add rich display cards for entities in chat
  - Implement interactive elements (confirm/cancel buttons, dropdowns)
  - Create visual feedback for operations in progress

- **Task for Non-Coder**: Create examples of complex workflows and expected outcomes.

### Phase 5: Refinement (Weeks 11-12)
- **Testing & Tuning**
  - Comprehensive testing across different query types
  - Improve prompt engineering for better accuracy
  - Add fallback mechanisms for failed queries
  - Implement user feedback collection

- **Documentation**
  - Create user guide for chat capabilities
  - Document example queries and commands
  - Add in-chat help system

- **Task for Non-Coder**: Test extensively with varied language and document edge cases.

## Technical Components

### 1. Chat UI Component
```
Location: src/components/ChatInterface/
Key files: ChatPanel.tsx, ChatMessage.tsx, ChatInput.tsx
```
- Responsible for visual display and user interaction
- Should use existing app styling (Tailwind)
- Maintain message history and scroll position

### 2. LLM Service Layer
```
Location: src/services/llm/
Key files: llmService.ts, promptTemplates.ts
```
- Handle API communication with Claude/OpenAI
- Manage API keys and quotas
- Structure prompts with proper context

### 3. Intent Parser
```
Location: src/services/intentParser/
Key files: intentParser.ts, entityExtractor.ts
```
- Classify user messages into operation types
- Extract relevant entities and parameters
- Determine required follow-up information

### 4. Data Access Layer
```
Location: src/services/dataAccess/
Key files: entityReader.ts, entityWriter.ts, securityValidator.ts
```
- Translate intents to Supabase operations
- Enforce security and access controls
- Handle database errors gracefully

### 5. Context Manager
```
Location: src/services/context/
Key files: conversationContext.ts, referenceResolver.ts
```
- Maintain state across conversation turns
- Resolve references to previously mentioned entities
- Track user intent across multiple messages

## Implementation Strategy for Non-Coders

### Using AI Tools Effectively
1. **Break Down Tasks**: Request code in small, focused chunks rather than entire components
2. **Provide Clear Context**: Always mention which file you're modifying and surrounding code
3. **Iterative Approach**: Build basic functionality first, then enhance incrementally
4. **Testing Prompts**: Create specific test scenarios for the AI to validate its own code

### Practical Steps for Each Component
1. Start by having the AI create a project structure and skeleton files
2. Focus on UI components first to visualize progress
3. Build read-only capabilities before adding data modification
4. Test extensively after each new feature addition

### Technical Understanding Requirements
- Basic React component structure
- Understanding of API calls and responses
- Familiarity with database concepts (but not specific SQL)
- Ability to read and understand TypeScript interfaces

## Risk Management

### Technical Challenges
- **Complex State Management**: Start with simpler state before adding advanced features
- **API Rate Limits/Costs**: Implement caching and throttling to manage API usage
- **Performance Issues**: Lazy load components and optimize API calls

### Non-Technical Challenges
- **Unclear User Requests**: Build robust disambiguation flows
- **Security Concerns**: Always implement confirmation for data changes
- **User Adoption**: Create clear documentation and examples

## Success Metrics
- Successful completion of basic operations through chat
- Response accuracy for varied phrasings of the same request
- User engagement with chat feature
- Reduction in time to complete common tasks

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a structured approach to adding LLM chat capabilities to the marketing calendar app. By breaking the project into manageable phases and focusing on one capability at a time, a non-coder can lead this project using AI assistance for the technical implementation details.
